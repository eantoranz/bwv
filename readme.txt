BWV Repo for Johann Sebastian Bach's compositions

The intent of this repo is to be able to hold Bach's compositions
in an easily accesible and _open_ format that doesn't depend
on proprietary applications to be used.

Hopefully, people will be able to use/modify/improve these files
and also share them, much the same way the Open Source / Free
Software movement does when developing FLOSS.



ABOUT BRANCHES

- master should hold works from straight manuscripts with
    as little edition/correction as possible ("errors" should
    be kept as-is from Bach's manuscript).
- Corrections/editions made by transcribers/editors/etc will be held
    in their own branches. This will allow to "easily" detect
    differences against Bach's manuscripts.

In case of questions regarding this point, will have to trust my
wisdom.
