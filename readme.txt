BWV Repo for Johann Sebastian Bach's compositions

The intent of this repo is to be able to hold Bach's compositions
in an easily accesible and _open_ format that doesn't depend
on proprietary applications to be used.

Hopefully, people will be able to use these files and modify them
and share them, much the same way the Open Source / Free Software
movement do when they develop FLOSS software.
